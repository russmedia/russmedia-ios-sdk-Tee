# Russmedia Tee iOS
iOS SDK for Russmedia Engagement Engine v 1.3.1

### Requirements

iOS Deployment Target `9.0`, Swift `5.3.1`. 

### Take it on board

#### Cocoapods

Check out [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/) tab on [cocoapods.org](http://cocoapods.org/). Than use following spec.

#### Embedded

Or use downloaded framework as embedded binary for your project.

![embedded](https://github.com/russmedia/Tee-ios-sdk/blob/master/readme_img/embedded.jpg)

### Camera permission

Framework uses native Camera for QR Code reader, so `Info.plist` of your app needs to provide static messages to display to the user when the system asks for camera or microphone permission: `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`.

### Make it run

First thing is, to import the framework.

```swift
import TeeSDK
```

Once imported, you can access singleton instance of the framework and implement some delegates methods and properties.

### onCall

Called, on every request, that is made by framework.

```swift
TEE.instance.onCall = { callName in
 print("Tee is making call")
}
```

### onMessageReceived

Called, when any message arrives. `onCall` and `onMessageReceived` may be a good place to paste own tracking of engine.

```swift
TEE.instance.onMessageReceived = { message in
 print("Tee is getting message")
}
```

### executeAfterInitialized

Method, that enques blocks, which are fired since TEE has initialised. Typically, wait with execution of relevant deeplinks, until any collector token is already received.

```swift
TEE.instance.executeAfterInitialized {
 print("Anonymous or logged-in user is active")
}
```

### executeAfterNotAnonymous

Method takes block, that is executed right when TEE has known, logged-in user. And as second parameter, takes expiration of block, that can invalidate execution after some time. Typically, since user is logged in, you may want to adapt his app UI.

```swift
TEE.instance.executeAfterNotAnonymous {
 print("User is finally logged in")
}
```

### handlePushRegistration

You may want to notify users, with targeting based on TEE profile. You can associate push notification token with specific user.
As additional, optional parameter, `pushAlias` you can pass specific string value, associated with token.

```swift
func application( _ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data ) {
 TEE.instance.handlePushRegistration(deviceToken: deviceToken, pushAlias: "aliasString")
}
```

### Catching users point milestones

You can catch users points progress via callbacks for any amount of points you need.

```swift
TEE.instance.addMilestone(forPointsCount: 10) {
 print("Another 10 points reached")
}
```

### isAnonymous

Readonly Bool for getting info, if currently running session is anonymous, or with logged-in user.

```swift
TEE.instance.isAnonymous
```

### verbosePrint

Talky log of communication with socket server in console. Default value is `false`

```swift
TEE.instance.verbosePrint = true
```

### presentingViewController

UIViewController, that is used for presenting overlayed modal views, for engagement engine notifications. You can disable notification by keeping this property unset.

```swift
TEE.instance.presentingViewController = window?.rootViewController
```

### popupCornerRadius

Optional styling of TEE popup window.

```swift
TEE.instance.popupCornerRadius = 30
```

### popupStaticWidth

Optional width of popup window, with absolut value.

```swift
TEE.instance.popupStaticWidth = 300 /// this is default value
```

### popupPercentWidth

Optional width of popup window, relative to device screen width. Overrides `popupStaticWidth`.

```swift
TEE.instance.popupPercentWidth = 80
```

### Connection to server

Since all props and delegates are set, you can enable connection itself with tracking of anonymous user.
Activity will be tracked and saved under new generic collector token.

```swift
TEE.instance.initConnection()
```

Whenever you determinate, that user is not anonymous anymore, you call init method again, with remoteId and userName as parameters. RemoteId should represent unique identificator of the user and userName, as optional parameter, as human readable string as display name.

```swift
TEE.instance.initConnection(remoteId: "bruce.wayne@gothamail.com", userName: "BMan")
```

Logout method will cancel session with given user and will get anonymous token to starts with points from 0.

```swift
TEE.instance.logout()
```

### Attaching and firing challanges in code

To enable challenges for each part of app, you call register method for every screen, that should hold elements to trigger challenges.
Each View is registrered for own challanges under unique string `detailPageId` and provides reference to root UIView of the screen.

```swift
TEE.instance.registerChallengesFor(detailPageId: "uniqueViewID", view: self.view)
```

Than, particular challenges can be triggered in code, using ID of challenge, with call:

```swift
TEE.instance.fireChallenge(withElementId: ".article-detail.selected .share.facebook")
```

### Attaching and firing via IB

You can set ID of challenge as `accessibilityIdentifier` of an `UIButton` or `TEEUIScrollViewObservable`. Than, when you register detail page with `registerChallengesFor(detailPageId:, view:)`, challenges will be attached, and fired automatically when interacting with the element.

For triggering scroll challenge, TEEUIScrollViewObservable subclass is required
```swift
@IBOutlet weak var scrollView: TEEUIScrollViewObservable!
```

### Detach challenges from view 

```swift
TEE.instance.resignViewForChallenges(withKey: "uniqueViewID")
```

### User activity indication

Engagement Engine measures also user activity in general. The best place to run `activityPing()` call is UIApplicationDelegate methods.

```swift
func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
 TEE.instance.activityPing()
}

func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
 TEE.instance.activityPing()
}
```

### Switch the language

You can call method `updateLanguage(lang: String)` on running session, to switch language of TEE UI for currently active collector token. Either anonymous or already paired one with user.  As a parameter, is expected Alpha-2 language code, ISO 639-1.

```swift
TEE.instance.updateLanguage(lang: "de")
```

### Format number of points in TEEPointsView

Use method `setPointsFormatter(_ formatter: NumberFormatter)` to pass number formatter, that is applied to every TEEPointsView in app while displaying current points.

```swift
let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.groupingSeparator = "."
formatter.numberStyle = .decimal

TEE.instance.setPointsFormatter(formatter)
```

### Own transition for displaying overview window

Use new public API:  `modalPresentationStyle: UIModalPresentationStyle?` and `presentationTransitioningDelegate: UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate?` on TEE instance, to specify your own transition to open overview page in app.

```swift
TEE.instance.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
TEE.instance.presentationTransitioningDelegate = MyTransitioningDelegate()
```

### Open overview page with deeplink

For opening TEE overview page on specific position, you can use public API: `handleDeepLink(_ url: URL)`, where URL includes GET parameter for navigating to relevant section. Method uses regular expression to harvest entry point from `?entry=` GET parameter. So valid URL object with specified entry string as GET parameter, should be inserted. Example URLs, you can pass:

- ...ttps://yourwebsite/open-gamification`?entry=/me/rewards`
- ...ttps://yourwebsite/open-gamification`?entry=/me/challenges`
- ...ttps://yourwebsite/open-gamification`?entry=/me/overview`
- scheme://your.app/whatever-text`?entry=/me/rewards`

```swift
TEE.instance.handleDeeplink(URL(string: "https://yourwebsite/open-gamification?entry=/me/rewards")!)
```

### Open Overview page with deeplink from HTML of your WKWebview

For opening TEE overview page from WKWebview, with specific deeplink, you register it's WKUserContentController by `TEE.instance.registerWKUserContentControllerForDeeplinks(controller: userController)` and set javascript listeners in webview, after DOM is loaded, by `TEE.instance.registerHTMLForDeeplinks(webview: webView)`.

```swift
private func initWebView() {
 let userController = WKUserContentController()
 let config = WKWebViewConfiguration() 
 config.userContentController = userController
 webView = WKWebView(frame: .zero, configuration: config)
 TEE.instance.registerWKUserContentControllerForDeeplinks(controller: userController)
}

func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {
  TEE.instance.registerHTMLForDeeplinks(webview: webView)
}
```

In HTML, you add class `tee-element` to identify TEE related element, which is automatically displayed as block, if TEE is present. Then class `tee-open-btn` to open TEE overview popup on click and attribute `data-open` to pass deeplink string to open. 

```html
<div class="tee-open-btn tee-element" style="display: none" data-open="/me/rewards/detail/123">
 My HTML link to page with reward ID 123
</div>
```

### Executing code, after user is successfully logged in TEE.

Method `executeAfterNotAnonymous(_ block: @escaping () -> Void, cancelAfter interval: TimeInterval = 0)` allows you to register block, that is fired, right when user is not anonymous anymore. If it won't be desired, to fire block after specific time frame, you can pass expiration time interval, timer will be invalidated and block released. In case of deep linking, you may want to check, if user is not anonymous. Anonymous user has limited content in TEE overview pages and it's beneficial to suggest login dialog first. 

Code below demonstrates option, how you can implement deep linking, with user-login step in the middle.

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {

 switch userActivity.activityType {
  case NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb:
   let url = userActivity.webpageURL!
   
   if userIsLoggedIn {  // your getter
    TEE.instance.handleDeepLink(url.absoluteString)
   } else {
    loginUser({ isSuccess in // your async login process
     if isSuccess {
      TEE.instance.executeAfterNotAnonymous({
       TEE.instance.handleDeepLink(url.absoluteString)
      }, cancelAfter: 5)
     }
    })
   }
   
  default: break
 }
 return false
}
```

### Info.plist requirements and optional properties

Engagement Engine is looking for two mandatory strings under `TEE` dictionary, that shoud be provided in `Info.plist`. TEE/ApiToken and TEE/liveSocketEndpoint

- TEE (Dictionary)
  - ApiToken (String)
  - liveSocketEndpoint (String)
  - devSocketEndpoint1 (String) // optional socket endpoint, selectable in debug console
  - devSocketEndpointXY (String) // optional socket endpoint, selectable in debug console
  - themeColorHex (String) // optional
  - pointsFontColorHex (String) // optional

### Sample implementation

```swift
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

 var window: UIWindow?


 func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

  TEE.instance.onCall = { callName in
   print("Tee is making call")
  }

  TEE.instance.onMessageReceived = { message in
   print("Tee is getting message")
  }
  
  TEE.instance.verbosePrint = true
  TEE.instance.initConnection() // Anonymous init
  TEE.instance.presentingViewController = window?.rootViewController

  return true
 }

 func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
  TEE.instance.activityPing()
 }

 func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
  TEE.instance.activityPing()
 }
}
```

```swift
import UIKit
import TeeSDK

class DetailViewController: UIViewController {

 @IBOutlet weak var scrollView: TEEUIScrollViewObservable!
  
 let pageKey: "productDetail123"
  
 override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
    
  // Associating scrollview with expected challenge code
  scrollView.accessibilityIdentifier = ".article-detail.selected .article.scroll"
    
  TEE.instance.registerChallengesFor(detailPageId: pageKey, view: self.view)
 }
  
 @IBAction func FBShareAction(_ sender: Any) {
  TEE.instance.fireChallenge(withElementId: ".article-detail.selected .share.facebook")
 }
  
 deinit {
  TEE.instance.resignViewForChallenges(withKey: pageKey)
 }
}
```
